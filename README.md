React app made using AImpact that connects to Solana and displays oracle and marketplace data: Features:
Wallet Integration: Connect your Phantom wallet using the button in the header
Oracle Data: Real-time price feeds from Pyth Network for SOL/USD, BTC/USD, and ETH/USD with confidence intervals and price charts
Marketplace Stats: Mock marketplace data showing total listings, volume, active users, and recent NFT listings
Responsive Design: Beautiful gradient UI with glassmorphism effects
The app fetches real Pyth oracle data from Solana devnet and updates every 10 seconds. The marketplace section uses mock data but can be easily connected to real marketplace programs once deployed.
